## Localhost Server for Horticulture Data

### Overview
This project aims to develop a localhost server that facilitates access to humidity and temperature data from a horticulture environment. The server is designed to connect with a locally hosted database, which is populated by an ESP8266 microcontroller. By providing a user-friendly interface, this solution enables users to conveniently monitor and analyze crucial environmental parameters for horticultural purposes.

### Features
- **Localhost Server**: The project includes a server component that runs on the local machine, allowing users to access the horticulture data through a web-based interface.
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**: The system employs an ESP8266 microcontroller to collect humidity and temperature data from the horticulture environment. This data is periodically transmitted to the locally hosted database.
- **Database Integration**: The server seamlessly integrates with a locally hosted database to store and retrieve the collected data. This ensures efficient data management and retrieval for analysis.
- **User Interface**: The web-based interface provides an intuitive and interactive platform for users to access, visualize, and analyze the horticulture data. It offers real-time updates and various graphical representations for easy interpretation.
- **Data Visualization**: The server incorporates data visualization tools to present the humidity and temperature trends over time. Users can explore graphs, charts, and statistical summaries to gain insights into the horticultural conditions.
- **Alerting Mechanism**: The system includes an alerting mechanism that notifies users in case of any predefined thresholds being exceeded. This feature helps ensure timely actions to maintain optimal horticulture conditions.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: The project is designed with scalability and flexibility in mind, allowing for easy integration with additional sensors, expansion of data collection capabilities, and customization based on specific horticultural requirements.
